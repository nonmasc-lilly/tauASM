## VERSION 0.0 -- HEXMOD -- ##
  HEXMOD simply includes the following directives:
    - org
    - db
    - times
  One could in theory define any program which you might want by simply hand writing the
  bytes, of course, this is... tedious, and is done here, mainly for testing purposes.

VERSION 0.1
  Full code cleanup holy shit im writing this with four hours sleep at 4AM what is wrong
  with me ~.~
